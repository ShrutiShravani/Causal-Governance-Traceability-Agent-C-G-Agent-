governance_notes: |
  - The ID column must remain in all datasets for traceability, 
    even though it is excluded from model training.
  - Demographic features (SEX, EDUCATION, MARRIAGE, AGE) 
    are used in the model so that the Causal Governance Agent 
    can measure their influence and detect bias.
  - During deployment, the XAI layer (e.g., SHAP or CausalML) 
    must validate that predictions do not unfairly depend on these features.
  - The model should primarily depend on repayment and billing behavior features 
    (financial capacity, repayment history, and repayment amounts).
  - Any significant contribution of demographic-sensitive features 
    must be flagged by the Critic Agent for compliance review.
